- The install step no longer requires interaction when installing
- Replaced the custom worker pool system with `tarn`
- Error messages are now sent back to the client instead of being displayed in rasterized output
- Updated NPM dependencies, removed deprecated and uneccessary dependencies
- Lots of smaller bugfixes and tweaks

_New Features:_

- Added `/health` route to server to display basic server information
- Added a UI served on `/` to perform exports from JSON configurations in browser

# 2.1.0

This version is not backwards compatible out of the box!

_Breaking changes:_

- Log destinations must now exist before starting file logging
- When running in server mode, the following options are now disabled by default:
  - `callback`
  - `resources`
  - `customCode`

Disabled options can be enabled by adding the `--allowCodeExecution` flag when
starting the server. Using this flag is not recommended, and should not be
done unless the server is sandboxed and not reachable on the public internet.
